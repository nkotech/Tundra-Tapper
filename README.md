PCB Files for a simple addon board for Tundra Trackers that let you feel interactions in VRChat using the [Haptic Pancake](https://github.com/Z4urce/VRC-Haptic-Pancake) software! 

You can buy them pre-made here: [https://nollelectronics.com/products/tundra-tapper](https://nollelectronics.com/products/tundra-tapper) 

The Keep Out area is to prevent you from getting the motor or any wires under the rubber bumper that the Tundra Tracker lower case uses to push the PCB against the main body to prevent any rattling. It's a bit bigger than it needs to be just in case the rubber bumper gets a bit offset.
